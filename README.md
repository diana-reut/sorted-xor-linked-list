My Little XOR List Experiment! ðŸ’–
This tiny C++ project is just me playing around with something super cool: a Sorted XOR Linked List! âœ¨

It's a quirky kind of list that saves memory by doing some clever pointer math (XOR-ing addresses instead of storing two separate pointers). Think of it like a memory-saving ninja! ðŸ¥·

I built this to peek into:

 - How to wiggle pointers around with XOR magic.
 - Making sure new data jumps into the right, sorted spot.
 - Figuring out how to walk through this tricky list.

It's a little brain-bender, but oh-so-satisfying when it clicks! This isn't for big, serious apps, just a fun coding adventure. ðŸš€

Hope you enjoy looking at the code!
