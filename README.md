My Little XOR List Experiment! ðŸ’–
This tiny C++ project is just me playing around with something super cool: a Sorted XOR Linked List! âœ¨

It's a list that saves memory by doing some clever pointer math (XOR-ing addresses instead of storing two separate pointers).

I built this to peek into:

 - How to wiggle pointers around using XOR calculations.
 - Making sure new data jumps into the right, sorted spot, be it at the start, end or between two other Nodes from the list.
 - Figuring out how to walk through this tricky list.

This isn't for big, serious apps, just a fun coding exercise.

Hope you enjoy looking at the code!
